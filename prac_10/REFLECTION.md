# Estimations
I forgot to keep adding these estimations to the top of each file. Overall i dont think my estimations would have improved as i tend to get distracted and walk away, and it takes several sessions to actually finish a task

# Code reviews
After getting some code reviews i have started to think "what would this look like to someone else" which motivates me to make cleaner code.

# Practical tasks
I wouldn't really change anything. I think they're good however i did struggle to get them done each week.

I havent done any good code reviews. I usually hae to rush them because i never seem to have much time
